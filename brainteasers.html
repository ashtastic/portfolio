          <h3>the concept</h3>
          <p>The entire book was design and built by hand. It is a compilation of brainteasers that are visual, typographical representations of terms aimed at offering graphic designers a way to stretch their mind and overcome creative–block. Each piece is drawn to be initially ambiguous in order to force the viewer to ignore the obvious and think abstractly, and enforcing creativity. Also, humour is used in the content for its awesome ability to clear the mind and relieve stress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-3 xl-1-3 island-half">

              <img class="img-flex" src="images/placeholder-375x350.jpg" alt="Image of CMYK.">
            </div>
            <p>Since this is a book aimed at graphic designers and print, the colours are cyan, magenta, yellow and black with the raw texture of craft paper to offer relaxed casualness and rough sketchbook culture to the activity surrounding the book.</p>
          </div>

            </div>
            <p>ITC American Typewriter was chosen for its balance between the casual fun and serious business that surrounds creative–block.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Each typographical illustration was drawn by hand on a grid so that they have a subtle uniform look about them, then brought into illustrator and formatted there.</p>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 gutter-half">
            <p><strong>step 1</strong> Researched as many graphic design terms I could find as well as looked at generic visual word teasers for inspiration.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 gutter-half">
            <p><strong>step 2</strong> Selected a few graphic design terms I could visualize as a pun and drew them out. This allowed me to weed out the weaker pieces and have a strong selection for the book.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 gutter-half">
            <p><strong>step 3</strong> Once the hand work was done, everything was laid out in InDesign, traced and coloured in Illustrator, and cut, glued, whole punched, and assembled by hand.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
          <div class="push-2 gutter-half">
            <img class="img-flex"src="images/placeholder-577x435.jpg" alt="Image of all the roughs of the typographical illustrations.">

        <h3 class="pad-t gutter-half">the technique</h3>
        <div class="grid push">
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 gutter-half">
            <p><strong>strict grid</strong> They layout of the book was set ahead of time in InDesign so that the proper grid could be printed and used to design the typographical illustrations. Each piece is different but they all have an overall coherency because of the grid. This also helped when laying out the flapdoor and content pages together.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 gutter-half">
            <p><strong>crafty assembly</strong> I printed the pages at a print shop to get high quality colours. Each page is four pages glued together: 2 different coloured content pages each covered with a kraft paper, flap door page. The coloured pages were in sequence of CMYK as you move through the book. Then these pages were whole punched and the metal rings were put through. The metal rings play along with the playful but mature balance of the book's theme.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 gutter-half">
            <p><strong>humour</strong> I am a strong believer in that humour can lighten up any mood and relieve stress. Stress is often the main culprit for experiencing creative–block, therefore the content in this book looks to engage the reader through humour by making fun of them for having to check the answer or giving them a fun fact. It lightens the mood of the book, making it fun despite its purpose for helping graphic designers to get back on track.</p>
