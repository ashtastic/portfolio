          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Research</h4>
          <p>Extensively researched all the competitors. None which were as focused on one geological area. Most acted as a personal inventory of the beers you try.</p>
          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Development</h4>
          <p>Defined the features and sketched out the app's flow and information architecture, as well as the app's interface design.</p>

          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">User Interviews</h4>
          <p>Conducted user interviews around campus to identify problem areas surrounding accessing information the app would be providing. Discovered that consumers need input from others, clear visual cues and detailed descriptions to try something new.</p>

          <h4 class="push-half text-lower kilo">Paper Prototype</h4>
          <p>I crafted long sheets of paper, where I drew screens on them, and made an iPhone out of mayfair to test the features I was hoping to design for the app. Discovered a few problems with navigation through the app and the usefulness of the newsfeed.</p>
          <h4 class="push-half text-lower kilo">Low Fidelity Prototype</h4>
          <p>Armed with illustrator and the iOS toolkit, I pieced together a bare-bones version of the paper prototype, with the adapted changes. The screens were fed through and animated in InVision and tested a second time, with very minor adjustments.</p>

          <h4 class="push-half text-lower kilo">High Fidelity Prototype</h4>
          <p>Adjustments from the second round of testing were made and a full colour and custom icon rendition of the app's UI was designed using Illustrator and brought into InVision for final demonstration and presentation.</p>
