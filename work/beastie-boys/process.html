          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Song Choice</h4>
          <p>Isolated my favourite part of the song, and listened to it a million times, flowing my arms and hands in and out to feel the movement of the type.</p>
          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Storyboard</h4>
          <p>Drew a storyboard with flowing arrows and words as I listened to the song another million times.</p>

          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Build</h4>
          <p>I figured out the actual timing of the music and then began to build in After Effects. The timing effects every object in the piece, so it needed to be tight.</p>

          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Musical Timing</h4>
          <p>Once I got the timing down, I set keyframes so the background changed colours like a metronome to the music. This set the pace and gave a strong back beat for the rest of the piece.</p>
          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Track Matte</h4>
          <p>Beastie Boys rap with a lot of punch and intonation, so I used track mattes to hide the extra bold type and flowing the words in strong, dramatic and heavy â€”paying close attention to illustrate the intonation of each lyric.</p>

          <h4 class="push-half kilo text-lower">Bouncing Animation</h4>
          <p>I animated the reggae beat with a bouncing null object by manipulating the curves and strategically placing the keyframes until I got it exactly right. I then parented everything to it to carry that head bouncing feel through to every object and movement, as well as to ensure that everything was in time with the music no matter when they flew in and out of the screen.</p>
