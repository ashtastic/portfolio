    <h3 class="text-lower">The Concept</h3>
    <p>“Don’t Play No Game That I Can’t Win” by Beastie Boys is a hip hop reggae golden nugget that came out on their Hot Sauce Commitee Part 2 album in 2011. In its typical Beastie Boy fashion, it's a guaranteed head bouncer.</p>

      <h4 class="push-quarter text-lower kilo strong">Typography</h4>
      <p>Used Futura Std ExtraBold to hit hard with the intonation but still be playful. The intensity of the lyrics don’t change, so neither does the weight and colour of the type.</p>

      <h4 class="push-quarter text-lower kilo strong">Colours</h4>
      <p>The solid colours are pulled directly from the Hot Sauce Commitee Part 2 album cover. A subtle tie to the source.</p>

      <h4 class="push-quarter text-lower kilo strong">Key Animation</h4>
      <p>Two key movements: bouncing and quick pop–ins. These were defined by the timing of the music and applied to every object in the piece.</p>
