  title: "The Concept"
  detail: "A parallax animation of mitosis —nuclear division that produces two identical cells. Special thanks to Chilled Cow – the Chill Instrumental Hiphop & JazzHop Mix (Part 2/5) for the audio."

    title: "Goopy animation"
    detail: "The animation was created to give a thick gelatinous liquid feel to the cells, illustrating how cell division tends to look like, especially with the subtle wiggling like jello."

    title: "Grids"
    detail: "Every element was laid out to a strict grid. For example, each typographical illustration was drawn by hand on a grid so to create unity among the individual pieces and the overall type layout, then brought into illustrator and formatted there."

    title: "Research"
    detail: "Researched as many graphic design terms I could find as well as looked at generic visual word teasers for inspiration."
  p2:
    title: "Graphic Design Terms"
    detail: "Selected a few graphic design terms I could visualize as a pun and drew them out. This allowed me to weed out the weaker pieces and have a strong selection for the book."

    title: "Build"
    detail: "Once the hand work was done, everything was laid out in InDesign, traced and coloured in Illustrator, and cut, glued, whole punched, and assembled by hand."

    title: "Strict Grid"
    detail: "The layout of the book was set ahead of time in InDesign so that the proper grid could be printed and used to design the typographical illustrations. Each piece is different but they all have an overall coherency because of the grid. This also helped when laying out the flapdoor and content pages together."
  t2:
    title: "Crafty Assembly"
    detail: "I printed the pages with a professional printer to get high quality colours. Each page is four pages glued together: 2 different coloured content pages each covered with a kraft paper, flap door page. The coloured pages were in sequence of CMYK as you move through the book. Then these pages were hole punched and the metal rings were put through. The metal rings play along with the playful but mature balance of the book's theme."
  t3:
    title: "Humour"
    detail: "I'm a strong believer in that humour can lighten up any mood and relieve stress. Stress is often the main culprit for experiencing creative–block, therefore the content in this book looks to engage the reader through humour by making fun of them for having to check the answer or giving them a fun fact. It lightens the mood of the book, making it fun despite its purpose for helping graphic designers to get back on track."
