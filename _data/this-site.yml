  title: "The Concept & Branding"
  detail: "My personal brand aims to attract the kind of awesome people I'd like to work with. It's a feel–good, conversational and approachable brand with character that's kind of weird and funny. It has a sort of childish maturity, where the goal is to be curious and fun balanced with solid and reliable hard work."

    title: "Branding"
    detail: "I went through a few weeks of intense introspection, self–reflection, and design–soul searching. This included sketching, note taking, journal writing, unicorn drawing, moodboards, brandboards, and logo development."

    title: "Typography"
    detail: "My focus is on the screen. Therefore, my brand's font is a web font. This typeface perfectly borders a mature and playful balance that is readable and communicates the conversational, confident and optimistic personality of the Ashley brand."

    title: "UX Focus"
    detail: "Built to be a portfolio piece on its own, I wanted this site to be focused on case studies. However, this meant content heavy layouts and a challenge to simple navigation. After multiple sketches, the result was a double navigation that prevents users from getting lost or having to scroll needlessly."

    title: "Developed from the brand"
    detail: "It was an easy decision to focus on motion and UX/UI design —I love making visual music with well thought–out design. As a result, my portfolio is a clean, simple interface, with white space, visual consistency, and the use of rules to separate content."
  p2:
    title: "Sketched and Wireframed"
    detail: "Having started with a dancing robot, things changed after extensive sketching and focus on my brand. I eventually moved onto Illustrator and designed mock-ups and wireframes. Through these I defined my type, where to put elements, and consistent user conscious layouts across devices."
  p3:
    title: "Coded"
    detail: "This site is coded using Jekyll, HTML5 and JavaScript. All pages are organized in the perfect balance where adding portfolio pieces relies solely on the effort of writing the content and collecting the visuals."

    title: "CSS Systems"
    detail: "I used previously developed type, column, modular, and grid systems to create a consistent layout across all devices and pages. These systems have type dependent spacing, and controlled column and grid organization."
  t2:
    title: "Jekyll"
    detail: "Used Jekyll to organize content and images consistently and as efficiently as possible across all pages. My rule was, if I'm copying and pasting, I would stop, and find a better way."

    title: "Java Script"
    detail: "Used for smooth animations and transitions throughout the navigation of the website."
