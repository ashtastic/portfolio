  title: "The Concept"
  detail: "I like challenging myself with topics I know nothing about. Cars are a great example because, not only do I not own one, but I am completely clueless when it comes to how they work. This unknown is what attracted me to the app's proposal. I felt my lack of knowledge would offer a resourceful level of empathy towards the target users."

    title: "Internet of Things"
    detail: "Car maintenance is an arduous, sometimes daunting and scary, thing. So, in order to overcome this perspective and empower owners, the design needed to be simple, enjoyable to use, and mimic a car's typical environment."

    title: "The mantra"
    detail: "Although using your phone while driving is an enormous safety risk, it was the mantra used for designing and ensuring the simplest navigation and access to info. The user should be able to check the status of their car as quickly, and directly, as possible."

    title: "Deciphering the needs"
    detail: "Poor students, busy service drivers, and multi–driver families were the target users. That meant the app had to be able to monitor multiple cars, have a dark interface to limit distraction while driving, and make it easy to evaluate and make decisions based on the data received from the vehicle, no matter the level of driving experience."
  p2:
    title: "Necessary UX principals"
    detail: "With mantra and users in mind, I isolated the necessary UX principals. These included a simple and clean interface for efficient access to information, graph and visual heavy to ease understanding, large click–able widgets, strategic navigation, and a visual alert system to explicitly decipher between elements that are healthy and those that need your attention."
  p3:
    title: "Design and Animation"
    detail: "I defined a solid, simple flow of how the visual elements, such as the graphs, would be displayed on the screen. I then designed the screens in Illustrator, isolated them, and put animated elements on separate layers. Once finished, I imported the screens to After Effects and applied consistent, carefully timed transitions across the screens to make a coherent overall experience."

    title: "Interface Design"
    detail: "Using the the material design icons, sticker sheets, and whiteframes, I pieced together system and custom elements to make up the UI. The goal was to create a dark interface to help with bright distractions while driving."
  t2:
    title: "Iconography and graphs"
    detail: "I designed the custom icons to be recognizable as dashboard icons but still follow material design characteristics. The graphs all have consistent line work that fills up space like a liquid. This was animated in After Effects using the stroke effect and masks."
  t3:
    title: "Animated Interaction"
    detail: "Strategically applied movement to the screens to reflect staggered transitions and entrances, side swipe movements, and the natural, non-distracting, but pleasant, appearance of elements."
