  title: "The Concept & Branding"
  detail: "Consumers in the Ottawa area have to search in a number of disjointed areas to get information on the craft beer in Ottawa and where to but it. Therefore, the Ottawa Brew Guide provides access to visual, descriptive and social information on the beer Ottawa craft breweries produce —all in one place."
  c1:
    title: "Logo"
    detail: "The imagery in the logo is the top of a growler. This is what craft beer in Ottawa is typically sold in when purchasing it directly from the brewery."

  c2:
    title: "Colours"
    detail: "The brand's colours are a mixture of browns and yellows derived from a retro–style look and feel. The colours are warm, but delicious, emulating the array of colours and opaqueness found in craft beer."

  c3:
    title: "Typography"
    detail: "Uses IOS system font for clarity and readability, since it is a content–heavy app. Stylized menu headers carry the retro feel, but digitized stability of a search engine —your own personal brew–expert robot."

    title: "Research"
    detail: "Extensively researched all the competitors, comparing positive and negative reviews, and the market for such an app. Most of the competitors offer clustered interfaces as a social inventory of the beers you try worldwide. None exist as a local tourism focus. Also, the craft brewery scene in Ottawa is a booming market that looks to continue growing, creating a competitive challenge for Ottawa-based breweries."
  p2:
    title: "User Interviews"
    detail: "Craft beer lovers make a vast target market. As a result, I walked around and asked random people what information they find most important when deciding and looking at consumable products. The result: users look for visual cues, descriptions, and the opinions of others."
  p3:
    title: "Development"
    detail: "Began with post-its, defined and illustrated a storyboard and functionality, defined a problem and app definition statement, and sketched the app flow, to end up with a testable prototype."

    title: "Paper Prototype"
    detail: "Drew the screens on long sheets of paper, and ran users through tasks, manually pulling the sheets through an iPhone made out of mayfair. Discovered a few problems with navigation and the usefulness of the newsfeed."
  t2:
    title: "Low Fidelity Prototype"
    detail: "Pieced together a bare-bones version of the paper prototype, with the adapted changes, using the iOS toolkit. The screens were fed through and animated in InVision and tested a second time. Discovered a few aesthetic problems, such as font size and spacing."
  t3:
    title: "High Fidelity Prototype"
    detail: "Adjustments from the second round of testing were made. Branding, full colour, and custom icon rendition of the app's UI was designed using Illustrator."
