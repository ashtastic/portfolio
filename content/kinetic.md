## beastie boys in kinetic type

### the concept
“Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win” by Beastie Boys is a hip hop, pop reggae gold nugget that came out on their Hot Sauce Commitee Part 2 album in 2011. It’s simple and, in its typical Beastie Boy fashion, a guarunteed head bouncer.

Used Futura Std ExtraBold to hit hard with the intonation but still be playful. The intensity of the lyrics don’t change, so neither does the weight and colour of the type.

The solid colours are pulled directly from the Hot Sauce Commitee Part 2 album cover. A subtle tie to the source.

Two key movements: boucing and quick pop–ins. These were defined by the timing of the music and applied to every object in the piece.

### the process

**step 1** Listening to the song a million times, usually in public, and flowing my arms and hands in and out to mimic the movement of the type.

**step 2** Drawing out a storyboard with boxes and flowing arrows and words as I listened to the song another million times.

**step 3** The magic of After Effects and figuring out the actual timing of the music (something like 4 beats per second). The timing effects every object in the piece, so it needed to be tight.

### the technique
**musical timing** Set the background to change like a metronome to the music. Not only did the colours in it pull in ties from the album art, but the actual timing of it also looks to tie in the whole timing and movement of the peice.

**bouncing animation** one bounce animation was defined for the whole piece. This bouncing animation was then applied to all the elements so that they move and bounce to the music in unison as they enter and leave the screen. 

**trackmat** every element is hidden behind a series of trackmats that are in synch with the boucing animation so to move and properly hide the type. Then, the type is shown from behind the trackmat in sequence to the lyrics in the song.
